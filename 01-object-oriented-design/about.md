## Object-Oriented Design

### About this Course

This course takes Java beginners to the next level by covering object-oriented analysis and design. You will discover how to create modular, flexible, and reusable software, by applying object-oriented design principles and guidelines. And, you will be able to communicate these designs in a visual notation known as Unified Modelling Language (UML).

You will be challenged in the Capstone Project to apply your knowledge of object-oriented design by evolving and documenting the Java codebase for an Android application with corresponding UML documentation.

After completing this course, you will be able to: 
1. Apply the Class Responsibility Collaborator (CRC) technique to analyze and design the object-oriented model for a problem.	
2. Explain and apply object-oriented modeling principles and their purpose (e.g., abstraction, encapsulation, decomposition, generalization).
3. Explain and apply different types of inheritance
4. Explain the difference between association, aggregation, and composition dependencies.
5. Express object-oriented models as Unified Modeling Language (UML) class diagrams.
6. Translate between UML class diagrams and equivalent Java code.
7. Apply design guidelines for modularity, separation of concerns, information hiding, and conceptual integrity to create a flexible, reusable, maintainable design.
8. Explain the tradeoff between cohesion and coupling.
